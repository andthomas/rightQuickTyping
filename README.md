# Right Quick

Live version: https://andthomas.github.io/rightQuickTyping/#/

Right Quick is a game to test your typing skills with your right hand. I built this primarily as a rehabilitation tool for people recoving from a stroke.

Built with:
- VueJS
- Vuex 
- vue-persited-state.
- Accuracy statistic calculated with [string-similarity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/string-similarity), based on Dice's Coefficient.
- Graph built with [chartJS](http://www.chartjs.org/).
